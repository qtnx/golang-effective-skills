### Getters

<a id="TOC-Getters"></a>

Function and method names should not use a `Get` or `get` prefix, unless the
underlying concept uses the word "get" (e.g. an HTTP GET). Prefer starting the
name with the noun directly, for example use `Counts` over `GetCounts`.

If the function involves performing a complex computation or executing a remote
call, a different word like `Compute` or `Fetch` can be used in place of `Get`,
to make it clear to a reader that the function call may take time and could
block or fail.
