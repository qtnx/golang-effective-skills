### Naming Printf-style Functions

When you declare a `Printf`-style function, make sure that `go vet` can detect
it and check the format string.

This means that you should use predefined `Printf`-style function
names if possible. `go vet` will check these by default. See [Printf family](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet#hdr-Printf_family)
for more information.

If using the predefined names is not an option, end the name you choose with
f: `Wrapf`, not `Wrap`. `go vet` can be asked to check specific `Printf`-style
names but they must end with f.

```shell
go vet -printfuncs=wrapf,statusf
```
