### Doc comments

<a id="TOC-DocComments"></a>

All top-level exported names must have doc comments, as should unexported type
or function declarations with unobvious behavior or meaning. These comments
should be [full sentences] that begin with the name of the object being
described. An article ("a", "an", "the") can precede the name to make it read
more naturally.

```go
// Good:
// A Request represents a request to run a command.
type Request struct { ...

// Encode writes the JSON encoding of req to w.
func Encode(w io.Writer, req *Request) { ...
```

Doc comments appear in [Godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/) and are surfaced by IDEs,
and therefore should be written for anyone using the package.

[full sentences]: #comment-sentences

A documentation comment applies to the following symbol, or the group of fields
if it appears in a struct.

```go
// Good:
// Options configure the group management service.
type Options struct {
    // General setup:
    Name  string
    Group *FooGroup

    // Dependencies:
    DB *sql.DB

    // Customization:
    LargeGroupThreshold int // optional; default: 10
    MinimumMembers      int // optional; default: 2
}
```

**Best Practice:** If you have doc comments for unexported code, follow the same
custom as if it were exported (namely, starting the comment with the unexported
name). This makes it easy to export it later by simply replacing the unexported
name with the newly-exported one across both comments and code.
