## Naming

### Test double and helper packages

There are several disciplines you can apply to [naming] packages and types that
provide test helpers and especially [test doubles]. A test double could be a
stub, fake, mock, or spy.

These examples mostly use stubs. Update your names accordingly if your code uses
fakes or another kind of test double.

[naming]: guide#naming
[test doubles]: https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch13.html#basic_concepts

Suppose you have a well-focused package providing production code similar to
this:

```go
package creditcard

import (
    "errors"

    "path/to/money"
)

// ErrDeclined indicates that the issuer declines the charge.
var ErrDeclined = errors.New("creditcard: declined")

// Card contains information about a credit card, such as its issuer,
// expiration, and limit.
type Card struct {
    // omitted
}

// Service allows you to perform operations with credit cards against external
// payment processor vendors like charge, authorize, reimburse, and subscribe.
type Service struct {
    // omitted
}

func (s *Service) Charge(c *Card, amount money.Money) error { /* omitted */ }
```

#### Creating test helper packages

Suppose you want to create a package that contains test doubles for another.
We'll use `package creditcard` (from above) for this example:

One approach is to introduce a new Go package based on the production one for
testing. A safe choice is to append the word `test` to the original package name
("creditcard" + "test"):

```go
// Good:
package creditcardtest
```

Unless stated explicitly otherwise, all examples in the sections below are in
`package creditcardtest`.

<a id="naming-doubles-simple"></a>

#### Simple case

You want to add a set of test doubles for `Service`. Because `Card` is
effectively a dumb data type, similar to a Protocol Buffer message, it needs no
special treatment in tests, so no double is required. If you anticipate only
test doubles for one type (like `Service`), you can take a concise approach to
naming the doubles:

```go
// Good:
import (
    "path/to/creditcard"
    "path/to/money"
)

// Stub stubs creditcard.Service and provides no behavior of its own.
type Stub struct{}

func (Stub) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }
```

This is strictly preferable to a naming choice like `StubService` or the very
poor `StubCreditCardService`, because the base package name and its domain types
imply what `creditcardtest.Stub` is.

Finally, if the package is built with Bazel, make sure the new `go_library` rule
for the package is marked as `testonly`:

```build
# Good:
go_library(
    name = "creditcardtest",
    srcs = ["creditcardtest.go"],
    deps = [
        ":creditcard",
        ":money",
    ],
    testonly = True,
)
```

The approach above is conventional and will be reasonably well understood by
other engineers.

<a id="naming-doubles-multiple-behaviors"></a>

#### Multiple test double behaviors

When one kind of stub is not enough (for example, you also need one that always
fails), we recommend naming the stubs according to the behavior they emulate.
Here we rename `Stub` to `AlwaysCharges` and introduce a new stub called
`AlwaysDeclines`:

```go
// Good:
// AlwaysCharges stubs creditcard.Service and simulates success.
type AlwaysCharges struct{}

func (AlwaysCharges) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }

// AlwaysDeclines stubs creditcard.Service and simulates declined charges.
type AlwaysDeclines struct{}

func (AlwaysDeclines) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error {
    return creditcard.ErrDeclined
}
```

<a id="naming-doubles-multiple-types"></a>

#### Multiple doubles for multiple types

But now suppose that `package creditcard` contains multiple types worth creating
doubles for, as seen below with `Service` and `StoredValue`:

```go
package creditcard

type Service struct {
    // omitted
}

type Card struct {
    // omitted
}

// StoredValue manages customer credit balances.  This applies when returned
// merchandise is credited to a customer's local account instead of processed
// by the credit issuer.  For this reason, it is implemented as a separate
// service.
type StoredValue struct {
    // omitted
}

func (s *StoredValue) Credit(c *Card, amount money.Money) error { /* omitted */ }
```

In this case, more explicit test double naming is sensible:

```go
// Good:
type StubService struct{}

func (StubService) Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }

type StubStoredValue struct{}

func (StubStoredValue) Credit(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error { return nil }
```

<a id="naming-doubles-local-variables"></a>

#### Local variables in tests

When variables in your tests refer to doubles, choose a name that most clearly
differentiates the double from other production types based on context. Consider
some production code you want to test:

```go
package payment

import (
    "path/to/creditcard"
    "path/to/money"
)

type CreditCard interface {
    Charge(*creditcard.Card, money.Money) error
}

type Processor struct {
    CC CreditCard
}

var ErrBadInstrument = errors.New("payment: instrument is invalid or expired")

func (p *Processor) Process(c *creditcard.Card, amount money.Money) error {
    if c.Expired() {
        return ErrBadInstrument
    }
    return p.CC.Charge(c, amount)
}
```

In the tests, a test double called a "spy" for `CreditCard` is juxtaposed
against production types, so prefixing the name may improve clarity.

```go
// Good:
package payment

import "path/to/creditcardtest"

func TestProcessor(t *testing.T) {
    var spyCC creditcardtest.Spy
    proc := &Processor{CC: spyCC}

    // declarations omitted: card and amount
    if err := proc.Process(card, amount); err != nil {
        t.Errorf("proc.Process(card, amount) = %v, want nil", err)
    }

    charges := []creditcardtest.Charge{
        {Card: card, Amount: amount},
    }

    if got, want := spyCC.Charges, charges; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
        t.Errorf("spyCC.Charges = %v, want %v", got, want)
    }
}
```

This is clearer than when the name is not prefixed.

```go
// Bad:
package payment

import "path/to/creditcardtest"

func TestProcessor(t *testing.T) {
    var cc creditcardtest.Spy

    proc := &Processor{CC: cc}

    // declarations omitted: card and amount
    if err := proc.Process(card, amount); err != nil {
        t.Errorf("proc.Process(card, amount) = %v, want nil", err)
    }

    charges := []creditcardtest.Charge{
        {Card: card, Amount: amount},
    }

    if got, want := cc.Charges, charges; !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
        t.Errorf("cc.Charges = %v, want %v", got, want)
    }
}
```
