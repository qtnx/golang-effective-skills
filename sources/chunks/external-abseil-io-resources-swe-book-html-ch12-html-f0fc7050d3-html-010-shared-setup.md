# Unit Testing

## Shared Setup

A related way tha t tests shared code is via setup/initialization logic.  Many test frameworks allow engineers to define methods to execute before each test in a suite is run. Used appropriately, these methods can make tests clearer and more concise by obviating the repetition of tedious and irrelevant initialization logic. Used inappropriately, these methods can harm a test’s completeness by hiding important details in a separate initialization method.

The best use case for setup methods is to construct the object under tests and its collaborators. This is useful when the majority of tests don’t care about the specific arguments used to construct those objects and can let them stay in their default states. The same idea also applies to stubbing return values for test doubles, which is a concept that we explore in more detail in Test Doubles.

One risk in using setup methods is that  they can lead to unclear tests if those tests begin to depend on the particular values used in setup. For example, the test in Dependencies on values in setup methods seems incomplete because a reader of the test needs to go hunting to discover where the string "Donald Knuth" came from.
  Example 12-23. Dependencies on values in setup methods
```go

private NameService nameService;
private UserStore userStore;

@Before
public void setUp() {
  nameService = new NameService();
  nameService.set("user1", "Donald Knuth");
  userStore = new UserStore(nameService);
}

// [... hundreds of lines of tests ...]

@Test
public void shouldReturnNameFromService() {
  UserDetails user = userStore.get("user1");
  assertThat(user.getName()).isEqualTo("Donald Knuth");
}
```

Tests like these that explicitly care about particular values should state those values directly, overriding the default defined in the setup method if need be. The resulting test contains slightly more repetition, as shown in Overriding values in setup methods, but the result is far more descriptive and meaningful.
  Example 12-24. Overriding values in setup methods
```go

private NameService nameService;
private UserStore userStore;

@Before
public void setUp() {
  nameService = new NameService();
  nameService.set("user1", "Donald Knuth");
  userStore = new UserStore(nameService);
}

@Test
public void shouldReturnNameFromService() {
  nameService.set("user1", "Margaret Hamilton");
  UserDetails user = userStore.get("user1");
  assertThat(user.getName()).isEqualTo("Margaret Hamilton");
}
```
