### Comment sentences

<a id="TOC-CommentSentences"></a>

Comments that are complete sentences should be capitalized and punctuated like
standard English sentences. (As an exception, it is okay to begin a sentence
with an uncapitalized identifier name if it is otherwise clear. Such cases are
probably best done only at the beginning of a paragraph.)

Comments that are sentence fragments have no such requirements for punctuation
or capitalization.

[Documentation comments] should always be complete sentences, and as such should
always be capitalized and punctuated. Simple end-of-line comments (especially
for struct fields) can be simple phrases that assume the field name is the
subject.

```go
// Good:
// A Server handles serving quotes from the collected works of Shakespeare.
type Server struct {
    // BaseDir points to the base directory under which Shakespeare's works are stored.
    //
    // The directory structure is expected to be the following:
    //   {BaseDir}/manifest.json
    //   {BaseDir}/{name}/{name}-part{number}.txt
    BaseDir string

    WelcomeMessage  string // displayed when user logs in
    ProtocolVersion string // checked against incoming requests
    PageLength      int    // lines per page when printing (optional; default: 20)
}
```
