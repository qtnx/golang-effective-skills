#### When to use a custom `TestMain` entrypoint

If **all tests in the package** require common setup and the **setup requires
teardown**, you can use a [custom testmain entrypoint]. This can happen if the
resource the test cases require is especially expensive to setup, and the cost
should be amortized. Typically you have extracted any unrelated tests from the
test suite at that point. It is typically only used for [functional tests].

Using a custom `TestMain` **should not be your first choice** due the amount of
care that should be taken for correct use. Consider first whether the solution
in the [*amortizing common test setup*] section or an ordinary [test helper] is
sufficient for your needs.

[custom testmain entrypoint]: https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Main
[functional tests]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing

[test helper]: #t-common-setup-scope

```go
// Good:
var db *sql.DB

func TestInsert(t *testing.T) { /* omitted */ }

func TestSelect(t *testing.T) { /* omitted */ }

func TestUpdate(t *testing.T) { /* omitted */ }

func TestDelete(t *testing.T) { /* omitted */ }

// runMain sets up the test dependencies and eventually executes the tests.
// It is defined as a separate function to enable the setup stages to clearly
// defer their teardown steps.
func runMain(ctx context.Context, m *testing.M) (code int, err error) {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
    defer cancel()

    d, err := setupDatabase(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, err
    }
    defer d.Close() // Expressly clean up database.
    db = d          // db is defined as a package-level variable.

    // m.Run() executes the regular, user-defined test functions.
    // Any defer statements that have been made will be run after m.Run()
    // completes.
    return m.Run(), nil
}

func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
    code, err := runMain(context.Background(), m)
    if err != nil {
        // Failure messages should be written to STDERR, which log.Fatal uses.
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // NOTE: defer statements do not run past here due to os.Exit
    //       terminating the process.
    os.Exit(code)
}
```

Ideally a test case is hermetic between invocations of itself and between other
test cases.

At the very least, ensure that individual test cases reset any global state they
have modified if they have done so (for instance, if the tests are working with
an external database).
