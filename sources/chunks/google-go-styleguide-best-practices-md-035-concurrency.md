#### Concurrency

Go users assume that conceptually read-only operations are safe for concurrent
use and do not require extra synchronization.

The extra remark about concurrency can safely be removed in this Godoc:

```go
// Len returns the number of bytes of the unread portion of the buffer;
// b.Len() == len(b.Bytes()).
//
// It is safe to be called concurrently by multiple goroutines.
func (*Buffer) Len() int
```

Mutating operations, however, are not assumed to be safe for concurrent use and
require the user to consider synchronization.

Similarly, the extra remark about concurrency can safely be removed here:

```go
// Grow grows the buffer's capacity.
//
// It is not safe to be called concurrently by multiple goroutines.
func (*Buffer) Grow(n int)
```

Documentation is strongly encouraged if any of the following are true.

*   It is unclear whether the operation is read-only or mutating:

    ```go
    // Good:
    package lrucache

    // Lookup returns the data associated with the key from the cache.
    //
    // This operation is not safe for concurrent use.
    func (*Cache) Lookup(key string) (data []byte, ok bool)
    ```

    Why? A cache hit when looking up the key mutate a LRU cache internally. How
    this is implemented may not be obvious to all readers.

*   Synchronization is provided by the API:

    ```go
    // Good:
    package fortune_go_proto

    // NewFortuneTellerClient returns an *rpc.Client for the FortuneTeller service.
    // It is safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
    func NewFortuneTellerClient(cc *rpc.ClientConn) *FortuneTellerClient
    ```

    Why? Stubby provides synchronization.

    **Note:** If the API is a type and the API provides synchronization in
    entirety, conventionally only the type definition documents the semantics.

*   The API consumes user-implemented types of interfaces, and the interface's
    consumer has particular concurrency requirements:

    ```go
    // Good:
    package health

    // A Watcher reports the health of some entity (usually a backend service).
    //
    // Watcher methods are safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
    type Watcher interface {
        // Watch sends true on the passed-in channel when the Watcher's
        // status has changed.
        Watch(changed chan<- bool) (unwatch func())

        // Health returns nil if the entity being watched is healthy, or a
        // non-nil error explaining why the entity is not healthy.
        Health() error
    }
    ```

    Why? Whether an API is safe for use by multiple goroutines is part of its
    contract.
