## Non-decisions

A style guide cannot enumerate positive prescriptions for all matters, nor can
it enumerate all matters about which it does not offer an opinion. That said,
here are a few things where the readability community has previously debated and
has not achieved consensus about.

*   **Local variable initialization with zero value**. `var i int` and `i := 0`
    are equivalent. See also [initialization best practices].
*   **Empty composite literal vs. `new` or `make`**. `&File{}` and `new(File)`
    are equivalent. So are `map[string]bool{}` and `make(map[string]bool)`. See
    also [composite declaration best practices].
*   **got, want argument ordering in cmp.Diff calls**. Be locally consistent,
    and [include a legend](#print-diffs) in your failure message.
*   **`errors.New` vs `fmt.Errorf` on non-formatted strings**.
    `errors.New("foo")` and `fmt.Errorf("foo")` may be used interchangeably.

If there are special circumstances where they come up again, the readability
mentor might make an optional comment, but in general the author is free to pick
the style they prefer in the given situation.

Naturally, if anything not covered by the style guide does need more discussion,
authors are welcome to ask -- either in the specific review, or on internal
message boards.
