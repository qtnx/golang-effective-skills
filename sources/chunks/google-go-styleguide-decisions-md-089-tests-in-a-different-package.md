#### Tests in a different package

It is not always appropriate or even possible to define a test in the same
package as the code being tested. In these cases, use a package name with the
`_test` suffix. This is an exception to the "no underscores" rule to
[package names](#package-names). For example:

*   If an integration test does not have an obvious library that it belongs to

    ```go
    // Good:
    package gmailintegration_test

    import "testing"
    ```

*   If defining the tests in the same package results in circular dependencies

    ```go
    // Good:
    package fireworks_test

    import (
      "fireworks"
      "fireworkstestutil" // fireworkstestutil also imports fireworks
    )
    ```
