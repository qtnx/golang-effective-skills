### Import Group Ordering

There should be two import groups:

- Standard library
- Everything else

This is the grouping applied by goimports by default.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "go.uber.org/atomic"
  "golang.org/x/sync/errgroup"
)
```

</td><td>

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "os"

  "go.uber.org/atomic"
  "golang.org/x/sync/errgroup"
)
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

### Package Names

When naming packages, choose a name that is:

- All lower-case. No capitals or underscores.
- Does not need to be renamed using named imports at most call sites.
- Short and succinct. Remember that the name is identified in full at every call
  site.
- Not plural. For example, `net/url`, not `net/urls`.
- Not "common", "util", "shared", or "lib". These are bad, uninformative names.
