### Formatting

All Go source files must conform to the format outputted by the `gofmt` tool.
This format is enforced by a presubmit check in the Google codebase.
[Generated code] should generally also be formatted (e.g., by using
[`format.Source`]), as it is also browsable in Code Search.

[Generated code]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/be/general.html#genrule
[`format.Source`]: https://pkg.go.dev/go/format#Source
