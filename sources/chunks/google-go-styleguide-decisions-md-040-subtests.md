## Test structure
<a id="subtests"></a>
### Subtests

The standard Go testing library offers a facility to [define subtests]. This
allows flexibility in setup and cleanup, controlling parallelism, and test
filtering. Subtests can be useful (particularly for table-driven tests), but
using them is not mandatory. See also the
[Go blog post about subtests](https://blog.golang.org/subtests).

Subtests should not depend on the execution of other cases for success or
initial state, because subtests are expected to be able to be run individually
with using `go test -run` flags or with Bazel [test filter] expressions.

#### Subtest names

Name your subtest such that it is readable in test output and useful on the
command line for users of test filtering. When you use `t.Run` to create a
subtest, the first argument is used as a descriptive name for the test. To
ensure that test results are legible to humans reading the logs, choose subtest
names that will remain useful and readable after escaping. Think of subtest
names more like a function identifier than a prose description.

The test runner replaces spaces with underscores, and escapes non-printing
characters. To ensure accurate correlation between test logs and source code, it
is recommended to avoid using these characters in subtest names.

If your test data benefits from a longer description, consider putting the
description in a separate field (perhaps to be printed using `t.Log` or
alongside failure messages).

Subtests may be run individually using flags to the [Go test runner] or Bazel
[test filter], so choose descriptive names that are also easy to type.

To [identify the inputs] of the function, include them in the test's failure
messages, where they won't be escaped by the test runner.

```go
// Good:
func TestTranslate(t *testing.T) {
    data := []struct {
        name, desc, srcLang, dstLang, srcText, wantDstText string
    }{
        {
            name:        "hu=en_bug-1234",
            desc:        "regression test following bug 1234. contact: cleese",
            srcLang:     "hu",
            srcText:     "cigarettát és egy öngyújtót kérek",
            dstLang:     "en",
            wantDstText: "cigarettes and a lighter please",
        }, // ...
    }
    for _, d := range data {
        t.Run(d.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got := Translate(d.srcLang, d.dstLang, d.srcText)
            if got != d.wantDstText {
                t.Errorf("%s\nTranslate(%q, %q, %q) = %q, want %q",
                    d.desc, d.srcLang, d.dstLang, d.srcText, got, d.wantDstText)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

Here are a few examples of things to avoid:

```go
// Bad:
// Too wordy.
t.Run("check that there is no mention of scratched records or hovercrafts", ...)
// Slashes cause problems on the command line.
t.Run("AM/PM confusion", ...)
```
