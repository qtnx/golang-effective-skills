## Useful test failures

### Got before want

Test outputs should include the actual value that the function returned before
printing the value that was expected. A standard format for printing test
outputs is `YourFunc(%v) = %v, want %v`. Where you would write "actual" and
"expected", prefer using the words "got" and "want", respectively.

For diffs, directionality is less apparent, and as such it is important to
include a key to aid in interpreting the failure. See the
[section on printing diffs]. Whichever diff order you use in your failure
messages, you should explicitly indicate it as a part of the failure message,
because existing code is inconsistent about the ordering.

## Useful test failures

### Full structure comparisons

If your function returns a struct (or any data type with multiple fields such as
slices, arrays, and maps), avoid writing test code that performs a hand-coded
field-by-field comparison of the struct. Instead, construct the data that you're
expecting your function to return, and compare directly using a
[deep comparison].

**Note:** This does not apply if your data contains irrelevant fields that
obscure the intention of the test.

If your struct needs to be compared for approximate (or equivalent kind of
semantic) equality or it contains fields that cannot be compared for equality
(e.g., if one of the fields is an `io.Reader`), tweaking a [`cmp.Diff`] or
[`cmp.Equal`] comparison with [`cmpopts`] options such as
[`cmpopts.IgnoreInterfaces`] may meet your needs
([example](https://play.golang.org/p/vrCUNVfxsvF)).

If your function returns multiple return values, you don't need to wrap those in
a struct before comparing them. Just compare the return values individually and
print them.

```go
// Good:
val, multi, tail, err := strconv.UnquoteChar(`\"Fran & Freddie's Diner\"`, '"')
if err != nil {
  t.Fatalf(...)
}
if val != `"` {
  t.Errorf(...)
}
if multi {
  t.Errorf(...)
}
if tail != `Fran & Freddie's Diner"` {
  t.Errorf(...)
}
```
