## Interfaces and other types

### Conversions

 The `String` method of `Sequence` is recreating the work that `Sprint` already does for slices. (It also has complexity O(N²), which is poor.) We can share the effort (and also speed it up) if we convert the `Sequence` to a plain `[]int` before calling `Sprint`.

```go

func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy()
    sort.Sort(s)
    return fmt.Sprint([]int(s))
}

```

 This method is another example of the conversion technique for calling `Sprintf` safely from a `String` method. Because the two types (`Sequence` and `[]int`) are the same if we ignore the type name, it's legal to convert between them. The conversion doesn't create a new value, it just temporarily acts as though the existing value has a new type. (There are other legal conversions, such as from integer to floating point, that do create a new value.)

 It's an idiom in Go programs to convert the type of an expression to access a different set of methods. As an example, we could use the existing type `sort.IntSlice` to reduce the entire example to this:

```go

type Sequence []int

// Method for printing - sorts the elements before printing
func (s Sequence) String() string {
    s = s.Copy()
    sort.IntSlice(s).Sort()
    return fmt.Sprint([]int(s))
}

```

 Now, instead of having `Sequence` implement multiple interfaces (sorting and printing), we're using the ability of a data item to be converted to multiple types (`Sequence`, `sort.IntSlice` and `[]int`), each of which does some part of the job. That's more unusual in practice but can be effective.
