#### Use `time.Duration` for periods of time

Use [`time.Duration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Duration) when dealing with periods of time.

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
func poll(delay int) {
  for {
    // ...
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(delay) * time.Millisecond)
  }
}

poll(10) // was it seconds or milliseconds?
```

</td><td>

```go
func poll(delay time.Duration) {
  for {
    // ...
    time.Sleep(delay)
  }
}

poll(10*time.Second)
```

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Going back to the example of adding 24 hours to a time instant, the method we
use to add time depends on intent. If we want the same time of the day, but on
the next calendar day, we should use [`Time.AddDate`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.AddDate). However, if we want an
instant of time guaranteed to be 24 hours after the previous time, we should
use [`Time.Add`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.Add).

```go
newDay := t.AddDate(0 /* years */, 0 /* months */, 1 /* days */)
maybeNewDay := t.Add(24 * time.Hour)
```
