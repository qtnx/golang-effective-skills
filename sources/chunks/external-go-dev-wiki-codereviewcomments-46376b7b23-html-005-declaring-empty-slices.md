## Declaring Empty Slices

When declaring an empty slice, prefer

```go
var t []string

```

over

```go
t := []string{}

```

The former declares a nil slice value, while the latter is non-nil but zero-length. They are functionally equivalent—their `len` and `cap` are both zero—but the nil slice is the preferred style.

Note that there are limited circumstances where a non-nil but zero-length slice is preferred, such as when encoding JSON objects (a `nil` slice encodes to `null`, while `[]string{}` encodes to the JSON array `[]`).

When designing interfaces, avoid making a distinction between a nil slice and a non-nil, zero-length slice, as this can lead to subtle programming errors.

For more discussion about nil in Go see Francesc Campoy’s talk Understanding Nil <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynoY2xz-F8s>.
