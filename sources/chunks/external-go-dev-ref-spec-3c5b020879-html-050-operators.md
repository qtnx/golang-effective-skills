## Expressions

### Operators

 Operators combine operands into expressions.

```go

Expression = UnaryExpr | Expression binary_op Expression .
UnaryExpr  = PrimaryExpr | unary_op UnaryExpr .

binary_op  = "||" | "&&" | rel_op | add_op | mul_op .
rel_op     = "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" .
add_op     = "+" | "-" | "|" | "^" .
mul_op     = "*" | "/" | "%" | "<<" | ">>" | "&" | "&^" .

unary_op   = "+" | "-" | "!" | "^" | "*" | "&" | "<-" .

```

 Comparisons are discussed elsewhere. For other binary operators, the operand types must be identical unless the operation involves shifts or untyped constants. For operations involving constants only, see the section on constant expressions.

 Except for shift operations, if one operand is an untyped constant and the other operand is not, the constant is implicitly converted to the type of the other operand.

 The right operand in a shift expression must have integer type [Go 1.13] or be an untyped constant representable by a value of type `uint`. If the left operand of a non-constant shift expression is an untyped constant, it is first implicitly converted to the type it would assume if the shift expression were replaced by its left operand alone.

```go

var a [1024]byte
var s uint = 33

// The results of the following examples are given for 64-bit ints.
var i = 1<<s                   // 1 has type int
var j int32 = 1<<s             // 1 has type int32; j == 0
var k = uint64(1<<s)           // 1 has type uint64; k == 1<<33
var m int = 1.0<<s             // 1.0 has type int; m == 1<<33
var n = 1.0<<s == j            // 1.0 has type int32; n == true
var o = 1<<s == 2<<s           // 1 and 2 have type int; o == false
var p = 1<<s == 1<<33          // 1 has type int; p == true
var u = 1.0<<s                 // illegal: 1.0 has type float64, cannot shift
var u1 = 1.0<<s != 0           // illegal: 1.0 has type float64, cannot shift
var u2 = 1<<s != 1.0           // illegal: 1 has type float64, cannot shift
var v1 float32 = 1<<s          // illegal: 1 has type float32, cannot shift
var v2 = string(1<<s)          // illegal: 1 is converted to a string, cannot shift
var w int64 = 1.0<<33          // 1.0<<33 is a constant shift expression; w == 1<<33
var x = a[1.0<<s]              // panics: 1.0 has type int, but 1<<33 overflows array bounds
var b = make([]byte, 1.0<<s)   // 1.0 has type int; len(b) == 1<<33

// The results of the following examples are given for 32-bit ints,
// which means the shifts will overflow.
var mm int = 1.0<<s            // 1.0 has type int; mm == 0
var oo = 1<<s == 2<<s          // 1 and 2 have type int; oo == true
var pp = 1<<s == 1<<33         // illegal: 1 has type int, but 1<<33 overflows int
var xx = a[1.0<<s]             // 1.0 has type int; xx == a[0]
var bb = make([]byte, 1.0<<s)  // 1.0 has type int; len(bb) == 0

```

#### Operator precedence

 Unary operators have the highest precedence. As the `++` and `--` operators form statements, not expressions, they fall outside the operator hierarchy. As a consequence, statement `*p++` is the same as `(*p)++`.

 There are five precedence levels for binary operators. Multiplication operators bind strongest, followed by addition operators, comparison operators, `&&` (logical AND), and finally `||` (logical OR):

```go

Precedence    Operator
    5             *  /  %  <<  >>  &  &^
    4             +  -  |  ^
    3             ==  !=  <  <=  >  >=
    2             &&
    1             ||

```

 Binary operators of the same precedence associate from left to right. For instance, `x / y * z` is the same as `(x / y) * z`.

```go

+x                         // x
42 + a - b                 // (42 + a) - b
23 + 3*x[i]                // 23 + (3 * x[i])
x <= f()                   // x <= f()
^a >> b                    // (^a) >> b
f() || g()                 // f() || g()
x == y+1 && <-chanInt > 0  // (x == (y+1)) && ((<-chanInt) > 0)

```
