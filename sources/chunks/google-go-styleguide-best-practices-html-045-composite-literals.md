### Composite literals

The following are composite literal declarations:

```go
// Good:
var (
    coords   = Point{X: x, Y: y}
    magic    = [4]byte{'I', 'W', 'A', 'D'}
    primes   = []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11}
    captains = map[string]string{"Kirk": "James Tiberius", "Picard": "Jean-Luc"}
)

```

You should declare a value using a composite literal when you know initial elements or members.

In contrast, using composite literals to declare empty or memberless values can be visually noisy compared to zero-value initialization.

When you need a pointer to a zero value, you have two options: empty composite literals and `new`. Both are fine, but the `new` keyword can serve to remind the reader that if a non-zero value were needed, a composite literal wouldn’t work:

```go
// Good:
var (
  buf = new(bytes.Buffer) // non-empty Buffers are initialized with constructors.
  msg = new(pb.Message) // non-empty proto messages are initialized with builders or by setting fields one by one.
)

```
