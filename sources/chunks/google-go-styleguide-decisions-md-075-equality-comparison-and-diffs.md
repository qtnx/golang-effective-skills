### Equality comparison and diffs

The `==` operator evaluates equality using [language-defined comparisons].
Scalar values (numbers, booleans, etc) are compared based on their values, but
only some structs and interfaces can be compared in this way. Pointers are
compared based on whether they point to the same variable, rather than based on
the equality of the values to which they point.

The [`cmp`] package can compare more complex data structures not appropriately
handled by `==`, such as slices. Use [`cmp.Equal`] for equality comparison and
[`cmp.Diff`] to obtain a human-readable diff between objects.

```go
// Good:
want := &Doc{
    Type:     "blogPost",
    Comments: 2,
    Body:     "This is the post body.",
    Authors:  []string{"isaac", "albert", "emmy"},
}
if !cmp.Equal(got, want) {
    t.Errorf("AddPost() = %+v, want %+v", got, want)
}
```

As a general-purpose comparison library, `cmp` may not know how to compare
certain types. For example, it can only compare protocol buffer messages if
passed the [`protocmp.Transform`] option.

<!-- The order of want and got here is deliberate. See comment in #print-diffs. -->

```go
// Good:
if diff := cmp.Diff(want, got, protocmp.Transform()); diff != "" {
    t.Errorf("Foo() returned unexpected difference in protobuf messages (-want +got):\n%s", diff)
}
```

Although the `cmp` package is not part of the Go standard library, it is
maintained by the Go team and should produce stable equality results over time.
It is user-configurable and should serve most comparison needs.

Existing code may make use of the following older libraries, and may continue
using them for consistency:

*   [`pretty`] produces aesthetically pleasing difference reports. However, it
    quite deliberately considers values that have the same visual representation
    as equal. In particular, `pretty` does not catch differences between nil
    slices and empty ones, is not sensitive to different interface
    implementations with identical fields, and it is possible to use a nested
    map as the basis for comparison with a struct value. It also serializes the
    entire value into a string before producing a diff, and as such is not a
    good choice for comparing large values. By default, it compares unexported
    fields, which makes it sensitive to changes in implementation details in
    your dependencies. For this reason, it is not appropriate to use `pretty` on
    protobuf messages.

Prefer using `cmp` for new code, and it is worth considering updating older code
to use `cmp` where and when it is practical to do so.

Older code may use the standard library `reflect.DeepEqual` function to compare
complex structures. `reflect.DeepEqual` should not be used for checking
equality, as it is sensitive to changes in unexported fields and other
implementation details. Code that is using `reflect.DeepEqual` should be updated
to one of the above libraries.

**Note:** The `cmp` package is designed for testing, rather than production use.
As such, it may panic when it suspects that a comparison is performed
incorrectly to provide instruction to users on how to improve the test to be
less brittle. Given cmp's propensity towards panicking, it makes it unsuitable
for code that is used in production as a spurious panic may be fatal.
