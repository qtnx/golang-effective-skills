### Type aliases

<a id="TOC-TypeAliases"></a>

Use a *type definition*, `type T1 T2`, to define a new type. Use a
[*type alias*], `type T1 = T2`, to refer to an existing type without defining a
new type. Type aliases are rare; their primary use is to aid migrating packages
to new source code locations. Don't use type aliasing when it is not needed.
