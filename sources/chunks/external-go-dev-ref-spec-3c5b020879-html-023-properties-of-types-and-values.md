# The Go Programming Language Specification

## Properties of types and values

### Representation of values

 Values of predeclared types (see below for the interfaces `any` and `error`), arrays, and structs are self-contained: Each such value contains a complete copy of all its data, and variables of such types store the entire value. For instance, an array variable provides the storage (the variables) for all elements of the array. The respective zero values are specific to the value's types; they are never `nil`.

 Non-nil pointer, function, slice, map, and channel values contain references to underlying data which may be shared by multiple values:

-  A pointer value is a reference to the variable holding the pointer base type value.
-  A function value contains references to the (possibly anonymous) function and enclosed variables.
-  A slice value contains the slice length, capacity, and a reference to its underlying array.
-  A map or channel value is a reference to the implementation-specific data structure of the map or channel.

 An interface value may be self-contained or contain references to underlying data depending on the interface's dynamic type. The predeclared identifier `nil` is the zero value for types whose values can contain references.

 When multiple values share underlying data, changing one value may change another. For instance, changing an element of a slice will change that element in the underlying array for all slices that share the array.

### Underlying types

 Each type `T` has an _underlying type_: If `T` is one of the predeclared boolean, numeric, or string types, or a type literal, the corresponding underlying type is `T` itself. Otherwise, `T`'s underlying type is the underlying type of the type to which `T` refers in its declaration. For a type parameter that is the underlying type of its type constraint, which is always an interface.

```go

type (
	A1 = string
	A2 = A1
)

type (
	B1 string
	B2 B1
	B3 []B1
	B4 B3
)

func f[P any](x P) { … }

```

 The underlying type of `string`, `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, and `B2` is `string`. The underlying type of `[]B1`, `B3`, and `B4` is `[]B1`. The underlying type of `P` is `interface{}`.

### Type identity

 Two types are either _identical_ ("the same") or _different_.

 A named type is always different from any other type. Otherwise, two types are identical if their underlying type literals are structurally equivalent; that is, they have the same literal structure and corresponding components have identical types. In detail:

- Two array types are identical if they have identical element types and the same array length.
- Two slice types are identical if they have identical element types.
- Two struct types are identical if they have the same sequence of fields, and if corresponding pairs of fields have the same names, identical types, and identical tags, and are either both embedded or both not embedded. Non-exported field names from different packages are always different.
- Two pointer types are identical if they have identical base types.
- Two function types are identical if they have the same number of parameters and result values, corresponding parameter and result types are identical, and either both functions are variadic or neither is. Parameter and result names are not required to match.
- Two interface types are identical if they define the same type set.
- Two map types are identical if they have identical key and element types.
- Two channel types are identical if they have identical element types and the same direction.
- Two instantiated types are identical if their defined types and all type arguments are identical.

 Given the declarations

```go

type (
	A0 = []string
	A1 = A0
	A2 = struct{ a, b int }
	A3 = int
	A4 = func(A3, float64) *A0
	A5 = func(x int, _ float64) *[]string

	B0 A0
	B1 []string
	B2 struct{ a, b int }
	B3 struct{ a, c int }
	B4 func(int, float64) *B0
	B5 func(x int, y float64) *A1

	C0 = B0
	D0[P1, P2 any] struct{ x P1; y P2 }
	E0 = D0[int, string]
)

```

 these types are identical:

```go

A0, A1, and []string
A2 and struct{ a, b int }
A3 and int
A4, func(int, float64) *[]string, and A5

B0 and C0
D0[int, string] and E0
[]int and []int
struct{ a, b *B5 } and struct{ a, b *B5 }
func(x int, y float64) *[]string, func(int, float64) (result *[]string), and A5

```

 `B0` and `B1` are different because they are new types created by distinct type definitions; `func(int, float64) *B0` and `func(x int, y float64) *[]string` are different because `B0` is different from `[]string`; and `P1` and `P2` are different because they are different type parameters. `D0[int, string]` and `struct{ x int; y string }` are different because the former is an instantiated defined type while the latter is a type literal (but they are still assignable).

### Assignability

 A value `x` of type `V` is _assignable_ to a variable of type `T` ("`x` is assignable to `T`") if one of the following conditions applies:

-  `V` and `T` are identical.
-  `V` and `T` have identical underlying types but are not type parameters and at least one of `V` or `T` is not a named type.
-  `V` and `T` are channel types with identical element types, `V` is a bidirectional channel, and at least one of `V` or `T` is not a named type.
-  `T` is an interface type, but not a type parameter, and `x` implements `T`.
-  `x` is the predeclared identifier `nil` and `T` is a pointer, function, slice, map, channel, or interface type, but not a type parameter.
-  `x` is an untyped constant representable by a value of type `T`.

 Additionally, if `x`'s type `V` or `T` are type parameters, `x` is assignable to a variable of type `T` if one of the following conditions applies:

-  `x` is the predeclared identifier `nil`, `T` is a type parameter, and `x` is assignable to each type in `T`'s type set.
-  `V` is not a named type, `T` is a type parameter, and `x` is assignable to each type in `T`'s type set.
-  `V` is a type parameter and `T` is not a named type, and values of each type in `V`'s type set are assignable to `T`.

### Representability

 A constant `x` is _representable_ by a value of type `T`, where `T` is not a type parameter, if one of the following conditions applies:

-  `x` is in the set of values determined by `T`.
-  `T` is a floating-point type and `x` can be rounded to `T`'s precision without overflow. Rounding uses IEEE 754 round-to-even rules but with an IEEE negative zero further simplified to an unsigned zero. Note that constant values never result in an IEEE negative zero, NaN, or infinity.
-  `T` is a complex type, and `x`'s components `real(x)` and `imag(x)` are representable by values of `T`'s component type (`float32` or `float64`).

 If `T` is a type parameter, `x` is representable by a value of type `T` if `x` is representable by a value of each type in `T`'s type set.

```go

x                   T           x is representable by a value of T because

'a'                 byte        97 is in the set of byte values
97                  rune        rune is an alias for int32, and 97 is in the set of 32-bit integers
"foo"               string      "foo" is in the set of string values
1024                int16       1024 is in the set of 16-bit integers
42.0                byte        42 is in the set of unsigned 8-bit integers
1e10                uint64      10000000000 is in the set of unsigned 64-bit integers
2.718281828459045   float32     2.718281828459045 rounds to 2.7182817 which is in the set of float32 values
-1e-1000            float64     -1e-1000 rounds to IEEE -0.0 which is further simplified to 0.0
0i                  int         0 is an integer value
(42 + 0i)           float32     42.0 (with zero imaginary part) is in the set of float32 values

```

```go

x                   T           x is not representable by a value of T because

0                   bool        0 is not in the set of boolean values
'a'                 string      'a' is a rune, it is not in the set of string values
1024                byte        1024 is not in the set of unsigned 8-bit integers
-1                  uint16      -1 is not in the set of unsigned 16-bit integers
1.1                 int         1.1 is not an integer value
42i                 float32     (0 + 42i) is not in the set of float32 values
1e1000              float64     1e1000 overflows to IEEE +Inf after rounding

```

### Method sets

 The _method set_ of a type determines the methods that can be called on an operand of that type. Every type has a (possibly empty) method set associated with it:

- The method set of a defined type `T` consists of all methods declared with receiver type `T`.
-  The method set of a pointer to a defined type `T` (where `T` is neither a pointer nor an interface) is the set of all methods declared with receiver `*T` or `T`.
- The method set of an interface type is the intersection of the method sets of each type in the interface's type set (the resulting method set is usually just the set of declared methods in the interface).

 Further rules apply to structs (and pointer to structs) containing embedded fields, as described in the section on struct types. Any other type has an empty method set.

 In a method set, each method must have a unique non-blank method name.
