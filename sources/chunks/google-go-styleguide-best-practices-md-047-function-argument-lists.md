## Function argument lists

Don't let the signature of a function get too long. As more parameters are added
to a function, the role of individual parameters becomes less clear, and
adjacent parameters of the same type become easier to confuse. Functions with
large numbers of arguments are less memorable and more difficult to read at the
call-site.

When designing an API, consider splitting a highly configurable function whose
signature is growing complex into several simpler ones. These can share an
(unexported) implementation if necessary.

Where a function requires many inputs, consider introducing an [option struct]
for some of the arguments or employing the more advanced [variadic options]
technique. The primary consideration for which strategy to choose should be how
the function call looks across all expected use cases.

The recommendations below primarily apply to exported APIs, which are held to a
higher standard than unexported ones. These techniques may be unnecessary for
your use case. Use your judgment, and balance the principles of [clarity] and
[least mechanism].
