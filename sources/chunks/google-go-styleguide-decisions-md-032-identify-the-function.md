## Useful test failures

### Identify the function

In most tests, failure messages should include the name of the function that
failed, even though it seems obvious from the name of the test function.
Specifically, your failure message should be `YourFunc(%v) = %v, want %v`
instead of just `got %v, want %v`.

## Useful test failures

### Identify the input

In most tests, failure messages should include the function inputs if they are
short. If the relevant properties of the inputs are not obvious (for example,
because the inputs are large or opaque), you should name your test cases with a
description of what's being tested and print the description as part of your
error message.
