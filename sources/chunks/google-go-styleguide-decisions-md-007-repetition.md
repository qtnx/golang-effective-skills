## Naming

### Repetition

A piece of Go source code should avoid unnecessary repetition. One common source
of this is repetitive names, which often include unnecessary words or repeat
their context or type. Code itself can also be unnecessarily repetitive if the
same or a similar code segment appears multiple times in close proximity.

Repetitive naming can come in many forms, including:

<a id="repetitive-with-package"></a>

#### Package vs. exported symbol name

When naming exported symbols, the name of the package is always visible outside
your package, so redundant information between the two should be reduced or
eliminated. If a package exports only one type and it is named after the package
itself, the canonical name for the constructor is `New` if one is required.

> **Examples:** Repetitive Name -> Better Name
>
> *   `widget.NewWidget` -> `widget.New`
> *   `widget.NewWidgetWithName` -> `widget.NewWithName`
> *   `db.LoadFromDatabase` -> `db.Load`
> *   `goatteleportutil.CountGoatsTeleported` -> `gtutil.CountGoatsTeleported`
>     or `goatteleport.Count`
> *   `myteampb.MyTeamMethodRequest` -> `mtpb.MyTeamMethodRequest` or
>     `myteampb.MethodRequest`

#### Variable name vs. type

The compiler always knows the type of a variable, and in most cases it is also
clear to the reader what type a variable is by how it is used. It is only
necessary to clarify the type of a variable if its value appears twice in the
same scope.

Repetitive Name               | Better Name
----------------------------- | ----------------------
`var numUsers int`            | `var users int`
`var nameString string`       | `var name string`
`var primaryProject *Project` | `var primary *Project`

If the value appears in multiple forms, this can be clarified either with an
extra word like `raw` and `parsed` or with the underlying representation:

```go
// Good:
limitRaw := r.FormValue("limit")
limit, err := strconv.Atoi(limitRaw)
```

```go
// Good:
limitStr := r.FormValue("limit")
limit, err := strconv.Atoi(limitStr)
```

#### External context vs. local names

Names that include information from their surrounding context often create extra
noise without benefit. The package name, method name, type name, function name,
import path, and even filename can all provide context that automatically
qualifies all names within.

```go
// Bad:
// In package "ads/targeting/revenue/reporting"
type AdsTargetingRevenueReport struct{}

func (p *Project) ProjectName() string
```

```go
// Good:
// In package "ads/targeting/revenue/reporting"
type Report struct{}

func (p *Project) Name() string
```

```go
// Bad:
// In package "sqldb"
type DBConnection struct{}
```

```go
// Good:
// In package "sqldb"
type Connection struct{}
```

```go
// Bad:
// In package "ads/targeting"
func Process(in *pb.FooProto) *Report {
    adsTargetingID := in.GetAdsTargetingID()
}
```

```go
// Good:
// In package "ads/targeting"
func Process(in *pb.FooProto) *Report {
    id := in.GetAdsTargetingID()
}
```

Repetition should generally be evaluated in the context of the user of the
symbol, rather than in isolation. For example, the following code has lots of
names that may be fine in some circumstances, but redundant in context:

```go
// Bad:
func (db *DB) UserCount() (userCount int, err error) {
    var userCountInt64 int64
    if dbLoadError := db.LoadFromDatabase("count(distinct users)", &userCountInt64); dbLoadError != nil {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("failed to load user count: %s", dbLoadError)
    }
    userCount = int(userCountInt64)
    return userCount, nil
}
```

Instead, information about names that are clear from context or usage can often
be omitted:

```go
// Good:
func (db *DB) UserCount() (int, error) {
    var count int64
    if err := db.Load("count(distinct users)", &count); err != nil {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("failed to load user count: %s", err)
    }
    return int(count), nil
}
```
